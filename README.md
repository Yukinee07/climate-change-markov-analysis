# Climate Change Emissions Analysis Using Markov Chain Modeling üåçüìä

A rigorous analytical project investigating the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions and their long-term impact on global climate change by applying discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain models.

---

## Project Overview

Climate change, fueled by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, poses one of the most critical challenges worldwide. This project analyzes carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) and other potent greenhouse gases' historical emission data from ten key countries ‚Äî Australia, Ukraine, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Russia, India, France, Japan, Germany, and Canada.

By employing Markov chain models, we examine emission state transitions over time, calculate steady-state probabilities, and forecast the persistence of emission levels. This offers a mathematical and data-driven approach to understand which factors most significantly influence climate change and aids in the formulation of targeted mitigation policies.

## What is the Problem?

- The rapid and unprecedented rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases exacerbates global warming.
- Identifying which gases and which nations contribute most to sustained high emissions remains complex.
- Current prediction methods require robust mathematical models that consider temporal state dependencies.

---

## Solution Approach

- **Markov Chain Modeling**: Utilizes transition probability matrices and stochastic processes to model emission level changes.
- **State Classification**: Emissions categorized into Low, Medium, and High states based on statistical thresholds.
- **Eigenvalue and Steady-State Analysis**: Computes long-term probabilities of persistent emission states and convergence time.
- **Country- and Gas-Specific Analysis**: Distinguishes key driving factors and regional emission behaviors.

## Key Findings

- CO‚ÇÇ emissions are the leading long-term driver of climate change in the analyzed countries.
- Several developing nations show strong convergence to persistently high emission states.
- Other greenhouse gases contribute less consistently but remain important in select regions.
- Without mitigation, many countries are forecasted to sustain high emission levels, urging urgent policy interventions.
